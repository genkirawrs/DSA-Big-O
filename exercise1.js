1. The Big O for the first scenario of finding golden retreiver playdate by yelling out to see if anyone responds would be an example of Constant Time. Since you're just calling out in to the crowd, it doesn't matter how large the crowd is - you're just calling out in to it and taking the first response.

2. This would be an example of Linear Time, you would go to each individual in the given group and check to see if they had a dog and if it was a golden retriever and then move one until you found the first that matched you criteria. The amount of time needed will increase proportionate to the size of the group.
